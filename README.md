# -Video-Summarization-by-Processing-library-java-

You are asked to:
1. Create a method to allow user to read and play input video (no GUI is required). The input video should have .MOV format and has its duration less than a few minutes.
2. Add option to select the method and do uniform and non-uniform summarization.
3. Allow user to control frame rate, duration of time to be summarized, etc.
4. Output a result of summarization in one image as shown above in the document.

How to do?
You are asked to use Processing library for this assignment. Processing (latest version 3.0) has been capable of reading and capturing the frame out of video in basic format such as .MOV.
However, if it is for only reading, playing and capturing some frames out, this is the fast and easiest method to perform a basic video operation.
Please read on these links to get knowledge on how to use processing in video operation:

Also, Elie Zananiri has written a good explanation on how to exactly read the video on: http://www.silentlycrashing.net/p5/libs/video/
